          <p>In an emergency, timely blood transfusion is very important to save lives. Hexacopters 
            hold a promise for quickly and efficiently delivering medical supplies, such as blood, 
            to remote or inaccessible areas. This report describes the design and development of a 
            hexacopter capable of carrying a 1 kg payload, specifically designed to transport 
            medical blood bags from one hospital to another within a 1 km distance within 10 to 
            15 minutes.</p>

            <h5>Design features</h5> 
            <p>Payload capacity: 1 kg <br>
              &nbsp;  b. Range: 1 km <br>
              &nbsp; c. Delivery time: 10 to 15 minutes <br>
              &nbsp; d. Using ultrasonic and LiDAR sensors for autonomous navigation <br>
              &nbsp; e. Stable and working Safe in emergency situations</p>

              <br>
              <p>
                Hexacopters are designed to maximize performance while ensuring stability and 
safety. The main products are: <br>
- Frame: A lightweight but sturdy frame that can carry loads and protect the outside. 
We will use carbon fiber as the material due to its high strength and light weight.
- Drive System: High - For high-efficiency brushless motors and propellers optimized 
for lift and durability. <br> <br>
- Flight controller: We will use a flight controller with navigation capabilities and 
sensor integration support. We will use Pixhawk as our primary flight controller and 
mission planner for navigation purpose. The battery could provide enough power for a 
long flight time, we will use Orange Company's 10000mAh Lion battery, which can 
provide power for up to 1 hour. <br> <br>
- Communication system: We will use RF transmitter and receiver to strengthen the 
communication link for the remote control and monitor the status of the hexacopter.

    <p>Creating a Power BI report for a blood donation system involves visualizing various aspects 
        of the system such as donor demographics, donation frequency, blood inventory levels, and 
        donation locations. Below is a basic outline of how you can create such a report: <br> <br> <b>Data Sources:</b> <br>a. Donor information (e.g., age, gender, blood type)
        <br>b. Donation records (e.g., donation date, location) <br>
        c. Blood inventory level
    <br>
    <b>Visualizations:</b><br>
    a. Donor Demographics:br>
    1. Pie chart showing the distribution of blood group.br>
    2. Count of gender br>
    3. Donor location map.br>
    b. Donation Frequency:br>
    1. Line chart showing the number of donations over time.br>
    2. Bar chart showing the number of donations per donor.br>
    c. Blood Inventory:br>
    1. Gauge chart indicating the current blood inventory level.br>
    2. Donut chart showing blood type distribution in inventory.br>
    d. Donation Locationsbr>
    1. Map visualizing donation locations.br>
    2. Bar chart showing the number of donations by location</p>
